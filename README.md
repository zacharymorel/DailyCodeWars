# DailyCodeWars

Hello, this is a remote repository where I keep up to date any Codewars or Hanker Rank problems I solve and the solutions I came up with

My Codewars Profile Link: https://www.codewars.com/users/ZacharyMorel

- Each folder represents a week; within each week folder are Javascript files that are sorted by day where the problems that I solve for that day. 

- I do provide the links to the problems with my solutions in case anyone would like to attempt the problems for themselves.
